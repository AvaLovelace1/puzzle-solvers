# puzzle-solvers
A collection of brute-force/backtracking logic puzzle solvers. Created to help my team in the [2019 Galactic Puzzle Hunt](https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzles) for the two puzzles [Something is Off](https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/something-is-off) and [Race for the Galaxy](https://2019.galacticpuzzlehunt.com/puzzle/race-for-the-galaxy).

The puzzles include:
- Gaps
- Kurodoko
- Puzzle 9 (2-Satisfiability)
- Scrabble (not the game)
- Tapa
- Tetropia
- Substitution Cipher Word Search
- Yin-Yang

## Usage
All solvers read from standard input and write to standard output. Sample inputs/outputs can be found in the `sample-inputs` folder.

All solvers will output all possible solutions, one after the other.
